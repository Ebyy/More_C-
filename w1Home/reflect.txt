PART A
1. The difference between internal and external linkage using examples from your code

Internal linkage makes a variable invisible to other translation units but visible to other 
scopes in its own translation unit by using the keyword static as seen in the case of the MAX variable
 while External linkage when a variable is made available for use to other translation units
 by using the keyword extern as used for the INITIAL variable

2. The execution effect of the code in the process() function that creates the String object 
which is inserted into standard output (which member function(s) does this code call)

It calls the the overloaded << non-friend helper function that in turn calls the display function 
then displays the string object to screen.

3. The changes that you made in upgrading your String class.

For my data member, I changed it to a C null terminated pointer then dynamically allocated the memory for 
each instance of the string class in the constructor using the NEW keyword.

PART B
QUIZ CORRECTION
Question 5. the keyword used to declare a class variable is static
 
Question 6. 
similarity: Union and Structs both have their privacy level as public
differnece: The size of a struct is a sum of the sizes of its data members as they all have their individual 
spaces allocated in memory while that of a union is set to the data with the largest size and utilized by a 
single data member at a time as it is just one space in memory allocated to the union and that one can only 
store data for just one member at a time.
